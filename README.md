First, download or clone a copy of this repository from BitBucket. For convenience, all necessary libraries are contained within this repository. Once downloaded, compile Magpie by copying "simple-build.xml" to "build.xml" and calling [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) using the command
```
#!shell

ant jar

### Downloading a Precompiled Version ###

A complete version of Magpie is available for [download](http://josquin.northwestern.edu/data-mining/magpie/Magpie.zip). Given that Magpie is written entirely in Java, this version should work without modification on any system with the Java Runtime Environment installed.
