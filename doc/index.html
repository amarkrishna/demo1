	<h2>What is Magpie?</h2>
	<p>Magpie is an acronym for &ldquo;Material-Agnostic Platform for Informatics and Exploration&rdquo;, and is named after an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoaEBb4IN4Q">intelligent bird</a>.
	
	<p>The overall goal in developing Magpie is to create a single platform for performing tasks that involve the application of machine learning to the design of new materials. This software package enables users to create, test, and share machine learning models that can be used for a broad range of applications.</p>
	
	<h2>Reasons to use Magpie</h2>
	
	<ol>
	<li>Ability to manipulate datasets, create models, and evaluate performance in the same program
	<li>Access to extensive library of machine learning algorithms through <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/">Weka</a>
	<li>Interactive text-based scripting interface
	<li>Easy sharing of models in a machine-independent format
	</ol>
	
	<h2>Getting Magpie</h2>

	<p>Magpie is freely available for <a href="http://josquin.northwestern.edu/data-mining/magpie/Magpie.zip">download</a>. The distribution of Magpie includes:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>All libraries necessary to run Magpie</li>
	<li>This manual, and documentation for the Java interface</li>
	<li>Example scripts for several common tasks</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Magpie is written entirely in Java, which allows it to be run on most computers without modification. As long as the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre7-downloads-1880261.html">Java&nbsp;7 Runtime Environment</a> is installed on your computer, Magpie should run without issue.</p>

	<h2>Learning About Magpie</h2>

	<p>If you are brand new to Magpie, you might want to read the "Text Interface" section of this manual and then review a few example scripts:
	
	<ul>
		<li><h3><a href="text-interface.html">Text Interface</a></h3></li>
		<li><h3><a href="../examples/index.html">Example Scripts</a></h3></li>
		<li><h3><a href="variables.html">Variable Types</a></h3></li>
		<li><h3><a href="java-interface.html">Java Interface</a></h3></li>
		<li><h3><a href="contributing.html">How to Contribute</a></h3></li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Additionally, you may also want to read the following article, which provides a short introduction to using machine learning to predict new materials and explains the science behind one of algorithms available through Magpie.</p>
