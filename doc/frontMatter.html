<h1>Magpie Manual</h1>
<p>Magpie is a software package designed to assist the design of new materials using machine learning. With only a few commands, Magpie allows an engineer to generate attributes that approximate chemical effects in a material, determine which ones correlate with a property of interest, and even build predictive models for that property. In place of implementing these operations is a language like Java, Magpie has a text-based interface where one controls a data mining program at higher level with simple instructions. For example, importing data from a file and training a model using <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/">Weka</a> can be accomplished in 4 lines:</p>

<code>
data = new data.Dataset
</br>data import data.csv
</br>model = new models.regression.WekaRegression trees.REPTree
</br>model train $data
</code>

<p>This manual describes all of the capabilities currently built into Magpie, and even provides links to a few example programs. If you are curious, Magpie stands for &ldquo;Materials-Agnostic Platform for Informatics and Exploration&rdquo;, and is named after an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoaEBb4IN4Q">intelligent bird</a>.

<h2>Getting Magpie</h2>
<p>Magpie is freely available for <a href="http://josquin.northwestern.edu/data-mining/magpie/Magpie.zip">download</a>. The distribution of Magpie includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>All libraries necessary to run Magpie</li>
<li>This manual, and documentation for the Java interface</li>
<li>Example scripts for several different tasks</li>
<li>A few datasets from the Wolverton group</li>
<li>Elemental property data used when modeling materials <b>[LW 3Jun14: Who owns this? Can I share it?]</b></li>
</ul>

<p>To get started, you might want to read the "Running Magpie" section of this manual and then review a few <b><a href="../examples/index.html">example scripts</a></b>.

<h2>Running Magpie</h2>
<p>Magpie is written entirely in Java, which allows it to be run on practically any system. To run it, you only need to install the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre7-downloads-1880261.html">Java 7 Runtime Environment</a>. The standard distribution of Magpie contains all of the required libraries and is run by executing the Java archive:</p>
<center><code>java -jar dist/Magpie.jar &lt;path to input script&gt;</code></center>

<p>A Magpie script works by creating variables and operating on them with commands specific to their type. As shown in the example in the introduction to this manual, these commands could be to import data from a text file, or train a model on a dataset. Magpie currently supports several kinds of variables, which include datasets, models, statistics calculators, optimization algorithms, and crystal-structure predictors. Each of these types perform a different part of a data mining task and, consequently, have different available commands. The latter part of this manual describes all of the available variable types and what commands they support.</p>

<p>A variable is created in Magpie using the following command:</p>
<center><code> &lt;variable name&gt; = new &lt;class name&gt; &lt;options...&gt; </code></center>

<p>Once created, you can perform many operations on a variable by issuing commands specific its type. Documentation for each of these commands for each known class are in the subsequent sections. Regardless of the type, commands are called by the syntax:</p>
<center><code> [&lt;output&gt; = ] &lt;variable name&gt; &lt;command...&gt; </code></center>

<p>For reference:  &lt;&gt;'s denote parameters in a command. If a parameter is surrounded by []'s, it is optional. If the name contains &apos;...&apos;, then you can supply multiple words for that parameter. Lastly, if there is a &apos;$&apos; in front of the parameter name, Magpie is expecting the value of a variable. The &apos;$&apos; symbol tells the program to access the value of the variable name whose name that symbol is affixed to.</p>

<p>Values stored in a variable are accessed using the print command: </p>
<center><code>print &lt;variable name&gt; &lt;print command...&gt;</code></center>

<p>The variables themselves can be saved to disk using the command:
<center><code>save &lt;variable name&gt; &lt;filename&gt; [&lt;format&gt;]</code></center>
</br>If no format is provided, the class will be saved to disk using serialization and 
 can be loaded back into memory using the command:</p>
<center><code>&lt;variable name&gt; = load &lt;path&gt;</code></center>

<h2>General Commands</h2>
<p>Outside of commands that operate on variables, a few other commands may be required for a complete script:</p>

<p><code>read &lt;filename&gt;</code>
</br>Reads all commands from a certain file. Returns control the calling script once complete.</p>

<p><code>types &lt;type&gt;</code>
</br>Print out all types of a variable available in your version of Magpie. Accepts things like "models", "datasets", or "csp".</p>

<p><code>list</code></br>Write out the types of all variables currently in memory</p>

<p><code>timer &lt;start|elapsed&gt; [&lt;name&gt;]</code>
<br>Simple timer functionality. "start" resets a timer to 0 and "elapsed" prints out how much time has elapsed. Multiple timers with different names can be stored and monitored concurrently. If no name is provided, time will be measured with respect to when Magpie was started.</br>

<p>
	<code>evaluate $&lt;model&gt; $&lt;dataset&gt; &lt;entries to evaluate...&gt;</code>
	</br>Given a model and dataset template to generate attributes, evaluate a series of entries.
</p>

<p><code>exit</code>
</br>Done. Close Magpie and get on with your life.</p>
